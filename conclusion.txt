From the analysis of the data and visualization, it can be concluded that radiation values for both clear sky and surface net solar radiaton are very low or equal to zero during the early and late hours of the day. This is because, at those hours of the day, the sun has not risen at the position i specified. However, radiation values are seen to increase drastically during the day because the sun rises and stays up during those hours.

Both clear sky and surface net solar radiation are observed to be very similar and this is because solar radiation at the location i specified is not strongly affected by cloud cover due to the scarcity of absorptive-radiation clouds in that region.
